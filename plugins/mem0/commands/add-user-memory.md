🚨 **EXECUTION NOTICE FOR CLAUDE**

When you invoke this command via SlashCommand, the system returns THESE INSTRUCTIONS below.

**YOU are the executor. This is NOT an autonomous subprocess.**

- ✅ The phases below are YOUR execution checklist
- ✅ YOU must run each phase immediately using tools (Bash, Read, Write, Edit, TodoWrite)
- ✅ Complete ALL phases before considering this command done
- ❌ DON't wait for "the command to complete" - YOU complete it by executing the phases
- ❌ DON't treat this as status output - it IS your instruction set

**Immediately after SlashCommand returns, start executing Phase 0, then Phase 1, etc.**

See `@CLAUDE.md` section "SlashCommand Execution - YOU Are The Executor" for detailed explanation.

## Available Skills

This commands has access to the following skills from the mem0 plugin:

- **memory-design-patterns**: Best practices for memory architecture design including user vs agent vs session memory patterns, vector vs graph memory tradeoffs, retention strategies, and performance optimization. Use when designing memory systems, architecting AI memory layers, choosing memory types, planning retention strategies, or when user mentions memory architecture, user memory, agent memory, session memory, memory patterns, vector storage, graph memory, or Mem0 architecture.
- **memory-optimization**: Performance optimization patterns for Mem0 memory operations including query optimization, caching strategies, embedding efficiency, database tuning, batch operations, and cost reduction for both Platform and OSS deployments. Use when optimizing memory performance, reducing costs, improving query speed, implementing caching, tuning database performance, analyzing bottlenecks, or when user mentions memory optimization, performance tuning, cost reduction, slow queries, caching, or Mem0 optimization.
- **supabase-integration**: Complete Supabase setup for Mem0 OSS including PostgreSQL schema with pgvector for embeddings, memory_relationships tables for graph memory, RLS policies for user/tenant isolation, performance indexes, connection pooling, and backup/migration strategies. Use when setting up Mem0 with Supabase, configuring OSS memory backend, implementing memory persistence, migrating from Platform to OSS, or when user mentions Mem0 Supabase, memory database, pgvector for Mem0, memory isolation, or Mem0 backup.

**To use a skill:**

## Security Requirements

**CRITICAL:** All generated files must follow security rules:

@docs/security/SECURITY-RULES.md

**Key requirements:**
- Never hardcode API keys or secrets
- Use placeholders: `your_service_key_here`
- Protect `.env` files with `.gitignore`
- Create `.env.example` with placeholders only
- Document key acquisition for users

**Arguments**: $ARGUMENTS

Goal: Add user-level memory to track preferences, profile data, and learned facts across all conversations.

Core Principles:
- Persistent user context
- Profile data extraction
- Preference learning
- Cross-conversation continuity

Phase 1: User Model Analysis
Goal: Understand current user data structure

Actions:
- Find user model/schema in codebase
- Check existing user properties
- Identify user identification method (user_id, email, etc.)
- Locate user profile or settings areas

Phase 2: Memory Schema Design
Goal: Plan user memory structure

Actions:
- Determine what user data should be remembered:
  - Preferences (language, tone, interests)
  - Profile facts (occupation, location, etc.)
  - Learned information (habits, patterns)
  - Long-term context
- Design memory categories and tags
- Plan memory retrieval queries

Phase 3: Implementation
Goal: Add user memory tracking

Actions:

Launch the mem0-integrator agent to add user memory.

Provide the agent with:
- User model: [Found in Phase 1]
- Memory schema: [Designed in Phase 2]
- Requirements:
  - Extract user preferences from conversations
  - Store user-level memories with user_id
  - Retrieve user context at conversation start
  - Update user memories as new info is learned
  - Add helper functions for user memory management
  - Generate UI for viewing/editing user memories (optional)
- Expected output: Complete user memory system

Phase 4: Verification
Goal: Test user memory works

Actions:
- Test preferences are learned from conversations
- Test user memories persist across sessions
- Verify user isolation (one user can't see another's memories)
- Check memory retrieval is fast and relevant

Phase 5: Summary
Goal: Show what was added

Actions:
- Display implementation:
  - User memory tracking: Enabled
  - Memory categories: [List]
  - Helper functions: [List]
  - Files modified: [List]
- Show usage examples:
  - How to manually add user memories
  - How to query user preferences
  - How to update user memories
  - How to delete user data (GDPR compliance)
- Provide next steps:
  - Test with user-specific preferences
  - Add UI for user memory management
  - Use /mem0:configure for retention policies
  - Use /mem0:test to validate user isolation
