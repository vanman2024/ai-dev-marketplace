## Security Requirements

**CRITICAL:** All generated files must follow security rules:

@docs/security/SECURITY-RULES.md

**Key requirements:**
- Never hardcode API keys or secrets
- Use placeholders: `your_service_key_here`
- Protect `.env` files with `.gitignore`
- Create `.env.example` with placeholders only
- Document key acquisition for users

**Arguments**: $ARGUMENTS

Goal: Add hosting and deployment configuration to an existing Claude Agent SDK application

Core Principles:
- Understand existing code before modifying
- Load SDK documentation for hosting patterns
- Follow official SDK examples

Phase 1: Discovery
Goal: Gather context about the project

Actions:
- Load SDK hosting documentation:
  @claude-agent-sdk-documentation.md
- Check if project path provided in $ARGUMENTS
- Read package.json or requirements.txt to confirm SDK is installed
- Identify main application files
- Ask user about hosting target (local, cloud, serverless)

Phase 2: Analysis
Goal: Understand current implementation

Actions:
- Read main application files
- Check if hosting configuration already exists
- Identify server setup or entry points
- Determine language (TypeScript or Python)

Phase 3: Planning
Goal: Design hosting implementation

Actions:
- Determine hosting platform (Express, FastAPI, serverless, etc.)
- Plan server configuration strategy
- Identify files to modify or create
- Present plan to user for confirmation

Phase 4: Implementation
Goal: Add hosting with agent

Actions:

Invoke the claude-agent-features agent to add hosting.

The agent should:
- Fetch hosting documentation: https://docs.claude.com/en/api/agent-sdk/hosting
- Set up server framework if needed
- Configure endpoint routing
- Add environment variable handling
- Implement proper error handling for hosting
- Add CORS and security configurations

Provide the agent with:
- Context: Project language, structure, and hosting target
- Target: $ARGUMENTS (project path)
- Expected output: Updated files with hosting setup

Phase 5: Review
Goal: Verify hosting works correctly

Actions:
- Invoke appropriate verifier agent:
  - TypeScript: claude-agent-verifier-ts
  - Python: claude-agent-verifier-py
- Check that hosting patterns match SDK documentation
- Verify server can start and handle requests

Phase 6: Summary
Goal: Document what was added

Actions:
- Summarize hosting capabilities added
- Show example deployment commands
- Link to SDK hosting documentation
- Suggest testing with local server startup
